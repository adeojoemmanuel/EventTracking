Event tracking
==============

This project is a solution for the Event tracking system built with Node.js, Express and DynamoDB. Deployed in a server-less way to AWS Lambda and AWS API Gateway using Claudia.js and dev local using gulp


Requirements Met
===============

- A non-relational database approched was picked so as to Handle Large Volumes of Data at High Speed  even with a Scale-Out Architecture
and also Store Unstructured, Semi-Structured, or Structured Data but most importanly for this project, it was selected to handle large data at highspeed, and also because dynamo db was recommended in the question

- the api accept the following credentials where i made use of joi validator to manage the data that are being received  to make sure they meet the required data type

```js
	{
		action_creator: 'the indentity of the person who created the action',
		receiver: '',
		event_type: 'the type of action that was created',
		event_hash: 'the hash of the params sent',
		time: 'the  time the action was performed',
		url_from: 'the url souce where the action was performed',
		agent: { a json object that carries information about the reqest, eg browser type, device type, ipaddress }
	}

```
- to handle duplicate  event we cache the last 5  requests for each client, and For every new request we check the cache for duplicate  action and event

- Data is accessible and analysable due the way they are stored, they can be queried using one field or multiple fields.


Endpoints
-----------

## Base URL : 'http://127.0.0.1/v1/'

- *POST* `/addEvent`

```js
{
  action_creator: required, string,
  receiver: required, string,,
  event_type: required, string,
  time: required, datetime,
  url_from: required, string,
  agent: required, json,
}
```

- *GET* `/listEvent`

```js
{
  action_creator: required, string,
  receiver: required, string,,
  event_type: required, string,
  time: required, datetime,
  url_from: required, string,
  agent: required, json,
}
```

- *POST* `/queryEvent`

```js
{
  action_creator:  string,
  receiver:  string,
  event_type:  string,
  start_date:  date,
  stop_date: date,
  url_from: string
}
```


Architecture
------------

Simple REST API deplyed in AWS Lambda persisting data into DynamoDB and retrieving data back.

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js micro web application framework. Express provides HTTP utility methods and middleware to create quick API.

API Gateway and Lambda together provides a secure, easy and elegant way to create and deploy serverless Web applications without the overhead of managing servers.

Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed and hosted AWS NoSQL database service.

Claudia.js is an open source Node.js deployment tool that helps automated deployment of Node.js app in a server-less way to AWS Lambda and AWS API Gateway.

Setting Up
-----------

The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:

### Get the latest snapshot

```shell
git clone --depth=1 git@github.com:adeojoemmanuel/EventTracking.git eventTracking
cd myproject
```

### Install NPM dependencies

```shell
npm install
```

To Install Gulp commandline run

```shell
sudo npm install -g gulp
```

Start App Local
===============

Execute gulp. This invokes app.local.js under scripts. gulp-nodemon Automatically restart Node.js server on code changes.

```
gulp
```

### deployment in AWS

the application was deployed to aws using `ClaudiaJS` to deploy the app in a server-less way to AWS Lambda and AWS API Gateway.

1.	Configure awscli
2.	Create table in DynamoDB
3.	Deploy App to AWS
4.	Push changes to AWS

### Configure awscli

```shell
pip install awscli
aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: XXXX
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: XXXX
Default region name [None]: us-east-1
Default output format [None]: json
```

Create Tables in DynamoDB
-------------------------

create-db is defined as task in package.json script. This executes scripts/createDB.js

```shell
npm run create-db
```

### Deploy App to AWS

Use deploy for first time deployment. deploy is defined as npm run task in package.json script

claudia create --policies policies --handler lambda.handler --deploy-proxy-api --region us-east-1

```shell
npm run deploy
```

### Push changes to AWS

Use update for update to initial deployment. update is defined as npm run task in package.json script

claudia update

```shell
npm run update
```
